We show a strong non-stationary coupling of ecological drivers in one of the world's major Mediterranean ecosystems, Doñana wetlands, which is currently threatened by many stressors. Recurrent changes in precipitation fluctuations triggered sudden reorganizations in community trends and population dynamics of a guild of ten wintering waterfowl species during a 36-year period. An anomalously dry and cold transient period in the Northern Hemisphere, induced by the volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, prompted an abrupt shift to an alternative regime of fluctuating species densities. Most species did not recover previous values even though local weather patterns and large-scale climatic conditions returned to normal values. Although the dynamical stability of the community is similar in both regimes, structural stability declined: the probability of feasibility dropped across time due to depressed population densities at equilibrium. A stochastic cusp catastrophe model fitted to the time series data suggests that the spatio-temporal persistence of cold and dry conditions in the wintering areas, coupled with warm and wet conditions in the breeding grounds, modulated local ecological conditions and induced hysteresis through behavioral shifts to alternative wintering sites. Our study provides empirical evidence for the existence of a catastrophic bifurcation triggered by a tipping point in the dynamics of an imperiled vertebrate community, highlighting the relevance of history and multi-stability in explaining current patterns in biological conservation.","tags":[],"title":"Catastrophic bifurcation in the dynamics of a threatened bird community triggered by a planetary-scale environmental perturbation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Almaraz","Félix Martínez","Zebensui Morales-Reyes","José A.

As long-lived species, the demographic dynamics of vultures can be disrupted by spatio-temporal fluctuations in food availability, with dramatic impacts on their population viability and the ecosystem services provided. In Europe, the outbreak of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in 2001 prompted a restrictive sanitary legislation banning the presence of livestock carcasses in the wild at a continental scale. In long-lived vertebrate species the buffering hypothesis predicts that the demographic traits with the largest contribution to population growth rate should be less temporally variable. The BSE outbreak provides a unique opportunity to test for the impact of demographic buffering in a keystone scavenger suffering abrupt but transient food shortages. We study the 42-year dynamics (1978-2020) of one of the world's largest breeding colonies of Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus). We fitted an inverse Bayesian state-space model with density-dependent demographic rates to the time-series of stage-structured abundances to investigate shifts in vital rates and population dynamics before, during and after the implementation of a restrictive sanitary regulation. Prior to the BSE outbreak the dynamics was mainly driven by adult survival: 83% of temporal variance in abundance was explained by variability in this rate. Moreover, during this period the regulation of population size operated through density-dependent fecundity and sub-adult survival. However, after the onset of the European ban, a one-month delay in average laying date, a drop in fecundity and a reduction in the number of fledglings induced a transient increase in the impact of fledgling and sub-adult recruitment on dynamics. Although adult survival rate remained constantly high, as predicted by the buffering hypothesis, its relative impact on the temporal variance in abundance dropped to 71% during the sanitary legislation and to 54% after the ban was lifted. A significant increase in the relative impact of environmental stochasticity on dynamics was modeled after the BSE outbreak. These results provide empirical evidence on how abrupt environmental deterioration may induce dramatic demographic and dynamic changes in the populations of keystone scavengers, with far-reaching impacts on ecosystem functioning worldwide.","tags":[],"title":"Long-term demographic dynamics of a keystone scavenger disrupted by human-induced shifts in food availability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

One of these algorithms, the so-called PHYSAT-Med, was developed specifically for the Mediterranean Sea due to the optical peculiarities of this basin. The method allows the detection from ocean color images of the dominant Mediterranean phytoplankton groups, namely nanoeukaryotes, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, diatoms, coccolithophorids, and Phaeocystis-like phytoplankton. Here, we present a new version of PHYSAT-Med applied to the Ocean Colour—Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) database. The OC-CCI database consists of a multi-sensor, global ocean-color product that merges observations from four different sensors. This retuned version presents improvements with respect to the previous version, as it increases the temporal range (since 1998), decreases the cloud cover, improves the bias correction and a validation exercise was performed in the NW Mediterranean Sea. In particular, the PHYSAT-Med version has been used here to analyse the annual cycles of the major phytoplankton groups in the Mediterranean Sea. Wavelet analyses were used to explore the spatial variability in dominance both in the time and frequency domains in several Mediterranean sub-regions, such as the Alboran Sea, Ligurian Sea, Northern Adriatic Sea, and Levantine basin. Results extended the interpretation of previously detected patterns, indicating the dominance of Synechococcus-like vs. prochlorophytes throughout the year at the basin level, and the predominance of nanoeukaryotes during the winter months. The method successfully reproduced the diatom blooms normally detected in the basin during the spring season (March to April), especially in the Adriatic Sea. According to our results, the PHYSAT-Med OC-CCI algorithm represents a useful tool for the spatio-temporal monitoring of dominant phytoplankton groups in Mediterranean surface waters. The successful applications of other regional ocean color algorithms to the OC-CCI database will give rise to extended time series of phytoplankton functional types, with promising applications to the study of long-term oceanographic trends in a global change context.","tags":[],"title":"Reproduction of Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Major Mediterranean Phytoplankton Groups from Remote Sensing OC-CCI Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://palmaraz.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

An individual-based hierarchical Bayesian time-series model (individual-based model; IBM) was developed to estimate the time-varying impact of climate and herbivory on individual pine sapling height growth in woodland and treeline ecosystems of southern Europe during a 16-year period. The performance of the IBM was compared to a linear mixed-effects (LME) model to test for potential inferential effects when individual variability is marginalized. Time-varying models were also compared to constant parameter approaches. Model fitting and posterior predictive checking suggests a better statistical performance of individual-scale, time-varying inference. LME modelling overestimated herbivory effects and underestimated environmental stochastic effects, and model validation indeed suggested severe overfitting in the LME model relative to the IBM strategy. These results reveal a potential failure of common aggregation strategies to correctly resolve the effects of climate and herbivory variability at the individual scale. Moreover, ignoring the time-varying nature of the effects may preclude the correct estimation of the temporal scale of climate and herbivory impacts. In general, we found stronger individual- and time-averaged effects of summer precipitation relative to the effects of herbivory, particularly at the treelines. Also, individual pine responses showed effects of the same sign more consistently in the case of precipitation. This suggests that precipitation is more pervasive at the population level, while herbivory act as a spatially aggregating force through individual-level damage. Synthesis. Our results suggest that accounting for individual and temporal variability in ecological inference greatly improves the assessment of the relative importance of climate and herbivory on species distribution shifts. Strong effects of precipitation at the treeline could allow tree upward expansion, although increasing ungulate populations and associated browsing damages might limit positive climatic responses of pine saplings in the near future. In this context, the spatially heterogeneous effect exerted by herbivory could result in diverse vegetation structures in ecotones, adding a new dimension to the predictions on climate-driven vegetation shifts.","tags":[],"title":"From the individual to the landscape and back: time-varying effects of climate and herbivory on tree sapling growth at distribution limits","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

This information has been used to predict the effects of climate change, mainly rising temperatures, on the future spatial distribution of wine regions and constraints on wine quality. On the other hand, some wine experts have identified the adaptive technological revolution of the wine industry as the main factor explaining rising wine quality; however, this hypothesis remains untested. Here, a timevarying coefficients regression approach is developed that is capable of partitioning the temporal effects of temperature on wine quality across sequential grape growing seasons, accounting for wine-rating uncertainty. Using data from the Bordeaux wine region from 1920 to 2009, it is shown that this model statistically outperforms the previously used constant regression models: A period characterized by strong effects of temperature on wine quality up to the mid-1960s was followed by an abrupt and steady decline to present marginal temperature effects. This pattern can be explained by key adaptive shifts implemented in the Bordeaux wine industry from the 1960s onwards, which likely dampened the relative impact of temperature on the inter-annual variability of wine quality. Additionally, estimated optimum growing-season temperatures are higher and more uncertain than previously modeled. These results suggest that previous approaches likely overestimated the effects of growing-season temperatures on Bordeaux wine quality during recent years. Consequently, the projected effects of future climate change on viticulture might be biased in this region","tags":[],"title":"Bordeaux wine quality and climate fluctuations during the last century: changing temperatures and changing industry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Recently, however, Blanco-Aguiar et al. (Eur J Wildl Res 58:433-439, 2012) have asserted that this conclusion is poorly evidence-based and can subsequently promote raptor persecution by hunters. In response to Blanco-Aguiar and colleagues, here we provide complementary insights that favour our earlier hypothesis. After explaining several key concepts of the hyperpredation process, we use additional data and analyses to show that (1) a synchronised regime shift (i.e. a step, abrupt change in population size) to significantly lower population levels in both the rabbit and partridge populations took place coinciding with the RHD outbreak; (2) rabbit and partridge population dynamics were highly synchronised after the RHD outbreak, but not before; (3) an enhanced spatial autocorrelation at all the spatial scales emerged after RHD for partridge populations; and (4) the main shared predators' diet patterns were consistent with the hypothesis of enhanced predation pressure as a plausible mechanism behind the observed partridge dynamics. We support the idea that hunting bag data may be useful to infer realistic population dynamics and the ecological mechanisms explaining them, provided that (1) they are corrected by the number of hunting licenses; (2) appropriate statistical tools are employed; and (3) methodological constraints are adequately taken into account. Finally, we argue that the opinion of Blanco-Aguiar and colleagues that our original results can lead to raptor persecution is a misinterpretation of our study. In this sense, we make an appeal for the importance of accurately differentiating between the ultimate (e.g. infectious diseases favoured by humans) and the proximate (e.g. enhanced predation pressure) causes of the decline in prey of economic interest (e.g. game species) in order to avoid unnecessary, unfounded or presumed conflicts with lobbies of conservation concern (e.g. hunters).","tags":[],"title":"Inferring ecological mechanisms from hunting bag data in wildlife management: a reply to Blanco-Aguiar et al.

For instance, waterfowl (ducks, geese and swans) usually breed widely dispersed throughout their breeding range and gather in large numbers in their wintering headquarters, but there is a lack of knowledge on the effects of the sequential environmental conditions experienced by migrating birds on the long-term community dynamics at their wintering sites. Here, we analyse multidecadal time-series data of 10 waterfowl species wintering in the Guadalquivir Marshes (SW Spain), the single most important wintering site for waterfowl breeding in Europe. We use a multivariate state-space approach to estimate the effects of biotic interactions, local environmental forcing during winter and large-scale climate during breeding and migration on wintering multispecies abundance fluctuations, while accounting for partial observability (observation error and missing data) in both population and environmental data. The joint effect of local weather and large-scale climate explained 31.6% of variance at the community level, while the variability explained by interspecific interactions was negligible (\u003c5%). In general, abiotic conditions during winter prevailed over conditions experienced during breeding and migration. Across species, a pervasive and coherent nonlinear signal of environmental variability on population dynamics suggests weaker forcing at extreme values of abiotic variables. Modelling missing observations through data augmentation increased the estimated magnitude of environmental forcing by an average 30.1% and reduced the impact of stochasticity by 39.3% when accounting for observation error. Interestingly however, the impact of environmental forcing on community dynamics was underestimated by an average 15.3% and environmental stochasticity overestimated by 14.1% when ignoring both observation error and data augmentation. These results provide a salient example of sequential multiscale environmental forcing in a major migratory bird community, which suggests a demographic link between the breeding and wintering grounds operating through nonlinear environmental effects. Remarkably, this study highlights that modelling observation error in the environmental covariates of an ecological model can be proportionally more important than modelling this source of variance in the population data.","tags":[],"title":"Estimating partial observability and nonlinear climate effects on stochastic community dynamics of migratory waterfowl","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Almaraz","Daniel Oro"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary material and code.\n","date":1317427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1317427200,"objectID":"7f7d5ecc42c3b0f0b29432b4f4125d52","permalink":"https://palmaraz.github.io/publication/journal-article/almaraz2011/","publishdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/almaraz2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that body size is a major life-history trait impacting on the structure and functioning of complex food webs. However, long-term analyses of size-dependent interactions within simpler network modules, for instance, competitive guilds, are scant. Here, we model the assembly dynamics of the largest breeding seabird community in the Mediterranean basin during the last 30 years. This unique data set allowed us to test, through a ‘‘natural experiment,’’ whether body size drove the assembly and dynamics of an ecological guild growing from very low numbers after habitat protection. Although environmental stochasticity accounted for most of community variability, the population variance explained by interspecific interactions, albeit small, decreased sharply with increasing body size. Since we found a demographic gradient along a body size continuum, in which population density and stability increase with increasing body size, the numerical effects of interspecific interactions were proportionally higher on smaller species than on larger ones. Moreover, we found that the per capita interaction coefficients were larger the higher the size ratio among competing species, but only for the set of interactions in which the species exerting the effect was greater. This provides empirical evidence for long- term asymmetric interspecific competition, which ultimately prompted the local extinction of two small species during the study period. During the assembly process stochastic predation by generalist carnivores further triggered community reorganizations and global decays in population synchrony, which disrupted the pattern of interspecific interactions. These results suggest that the major patterns detected in complex food webs can hold as well for simpler sub-modules of these networks involving non-trophic interactions, and highlight the shifting ecological processes impacting on assembling vs. asymptotic communities.","tags":[],"title":"Size-mediated non-trophic interactions and stochastic predation drive assembly and dynamics in a seabird community","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ainara Cortes-Avizanda","Pablo Almaraz","Martina Carrete","Jose A.

Theoretical studies suggest that changes in food distribution can promote changes in the social arrangement of individuals without apparent adaptive value. Empirical research on this subject has only been performed at reduced geographical scales and/or for single species. However, the relative contribution of food patchiness and predictability, both in space and time, to abundance and sociality can vary among species, depending on their degree of flexibility. By means of constrained zero-inflated Generalized Additive Models we analysed the spatial distribution of two trans-Saharan avian scavengers that breed (Europe) and winter (Africa) sympatrically, in relation to food availability. In the summering grounds, the probability of finding large numbers of both species increases close to predictable feeding sources, whereas in the wintering grounds, where food resources are widespread, we did not find such aggregation patterns, except for the black kite, which aggregated at desert locust outbreaks. The comparison of diets in both species through stable isotopes revealed that their diets overlapped during summering, but not during wintering. Our results suggest that bird sociality at feeding grounds is closely linked to the pattern of spatial distribution and predictability of trophic resources, which are ultimately induced by human activities. Migrant species can show adaptive foraging strategies to face changing distribution of food availability in both wintering and summering quarters. Understanding these effects is a key aspect for predicting the fitness costs and population consequences of habitat transformations on the viability of endangered migratory species.","tags":[],"title":"Spatial Heterogeneity in Resource Distribution Promotes Facultative Sociality in Two Trans-Saharan Migratory Birds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos Moleon","Pablo Almaraz","Jose A.

This scarcely documented mechanism has been previously studied in scenarios in which the introduction of a feral prey caused overexploitation of native prey. Here we provide evidence of a previously unreported link between Emergent Infectious Diseases (EIDs) and hyperpredation on a predator-prey community. We show how a viral outbreak caused the population collapse of a host prey at a large spatial scale, which subsequently promoted higher-than-normal predation intensity on a second prey from shared predators. Thus, the disease left a population dynamic fingerprint both in the primary host prey, through direct mortality from the disease, and indirectly in the secondary prey, through hyperpredation. This resulted in synchronized prey population dynamics at a large spatio-temporal scale. We therefore provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which EIDs can disrupt a predator-prey interaction from the individual behavior to the population dynamics. This mechanism can pose a further threat to biodiversity through the human-aided disruption of ecological interactions at large spatial and temporal scales.","tags":[],"title":"An Emerging Infectious Disease Triggering Large-Scale Hyperpredation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.A. Rendon","A.J.

We used Underhill indices to replace missing values and to correct for flocks of unidentified ducks. Based on long-term means, we identified 16 species whose populations at Doñana exceed 1% of the biogeographical flyway population. For at least 1 month of the year, mean counts were around 10% of the flyway population for six species. The natural, temporary marshes of Doñana National Park were particularly important for Anatidae, ricefields for gulls, white storks and grey herons, fish ponds for flamingos, cormorants and avocets, and salt pans for shelduck. Four Anatidae species have undergone long-term declines and eight non-Anatidae have undergone long-term increases. Population trends were related with trophic guild, migratory status and habitat use. Winter visitors and herbivorous species showed more negative trends than resident, omnivorous-carnivorous species. Those species concentrated in strictly-protected natural marshes have tended to decline. The surface area of ricefields and fish ponds has increased over the study period, and bird species concentrated in these artificial wetlands have tended to increase. This raises questions about the value of waterbirds as flagship or umbrella species for wetland conservation.","tags":[],"title":"Status, distribution and long-term changes in the waterbird community wintering in Doñana, south–west Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Almaraz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1112313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1112313600,"objectID":"6f2bbbc336af7bde5368d7a6ce52cf14","permalink":"https://palmaraz.github.io/publication/journal-article/almaraz2005/","publishdate":"2005-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/almaraz2005/","section":"publication","summary":"Time-series analyses in ecology usually involve the use of autoregressive modelling through direct and/or delayed difference equations, which severely restricts the ability of the modeler to structure complex causal relationships within a multivariate frame.

A nonparametric bootstrap scheme illustrates how this modelling approach can circumvent some problems posed by the climate-ecology interface.

Our results suggest that the spatial and numeric dynamics of ducks between peak brood emergence and wintering were simultaneously affected by different climatic phenomena during different phases of their global cycles, involving time lags in the numeric dynamics.

Facing the current lack of knowledge on the nature and consequences of regulation for waterfowl populations, this type of study seems timely. A measure of population density accounting for the spatial patchiness of the population was constructed for breeding and wintering counts. No relationship was found between spatial and numeric dynamics, which suggests different mechanisms for both dynamical patterns. Although a lagged non-linear climatic effect during the period of chick rearing enhanced numeric brood recruitment through a cohort effect, in the short term brood production appeared to decrease with increasing population density, despite a long-term exponential numeric growth. Both wintering population density and rainfall during post-nuptial moult exerted a positive effect on subsequent spatial expansion during breeding, which suggest a major role for social interactions during wintering and wetlands availability on spatial dynamics. Altogether, the results suggest that seasonality, density-dependence and climatic forcing are all major processes in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the white-headed duck.
